    "I am working alone and my plan for working on this is to start little by little everyday coding and figuring out what to do based on the rubric and assignment details. I plan on first cleaning up my data and then going from there. THe amount of time i plan to dedicate to this project would be up to 2-5 hours maybe every two days or every other day. I will try and set up calendar reminders and put in the work on the days I don't have class and weekends. \n",

    "One model I have in mind would be clustering because it will cluster up the data into similarities which is what I would need to conduct in order to see similarities in music and personality. I could do hierarchical clustering to see the tree of information and will make it easier to see the relationships. \n",
